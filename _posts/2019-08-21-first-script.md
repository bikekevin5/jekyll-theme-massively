Just test this out and see what happens

Add some setting and intro to allow readers to get into the setting.
That would include any mentions of this is being produced at where when and Why

you would also want to use this as a template blog post and see if you want to
include images systematically instead

assuming that all your scripts will be broken down like This
assume do it by hand First
and then go back and template it??

<h2>Box</h2>
<div class="box">
	<p>In both layman and nerd-speak, this is a paragraph. This is a paragraph that goes inside a box! Whoa so crazy. This is the text that goes under the heading and the subtitle. Paragraphs vary in length but in school we're taught to make them at least 7 sentences or else we risk getting a C. Since the paragraph didn't have a thesis or a closing argument, it's probably a C grade paragraph.</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>
<div class="box">
Subterranean follows the journey of two scientists exploring a cave in search
of a mysterious geode promising fortune and fame.

With captivating imagery and concise dialogue, this play examines how far
one should go in search of truth and whether the pursuit of life is worth
risking its loss.

Written by Kevin Lim and Directed by _ _ , Subterranean will be featured in
Bindlestiff Studio's Stories High IX (link), with _ _ as Doc and _ _ as Indio.

<h2>ACT I</h2>

<h3>Scene 1: Interior Cave,
Calaveras Country</h3>

Spotlight up on Indio being lowered by rope down
into a damp cave. Indio wears cave exploring gear -
a helmet and headlamp. On the other side of the
rope is Doc.
