<h2>Intro</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>Subterranean follows the journey of two scientists exploring a cave in search
of a mysterious geode promising fortune and fame. With captivating imagery and
concise dialogue, this play examines how far one should go in search of truth
and whether the pursuit of life is worth risking its loss.</p>

<p>Written by Kevin Lim and Directed by _ _ , Subterranean will be featured in
Bindlestiff Studio's Stories High IX (link), with _ _ as Doc and _ _ as Indio.</p>

<h2>ACT I</h2>

<h3>Scene 1: Interior Cave,
Calaveras Country</h3>

Spotlight up on Indio being lowered by rope down
into a damp cave. Indio wears cave exploring gear -
a helmet and headlamp. On the other side of the
rope is Doc.

(1) BELAY ON
<b>INDIO</b>
 Belay on Doc

<b>DOC</b>
 On Belay Indio

<b>INDIO</b>
 I don't think it's here

<b>DOC</b>
 Doesn't your dissertation depend on finding it?

<b>INDIO</b>
 It would be deeper

<b>DOC</b>
 So lower?

<b>INDIO</b>
 Yeah

<b>DOC</b>
           (belaying the rope)
 Lowering

      (Indio lowered deeper into the stalagmites)

<b>INDIO</b>
 Tension Doc

<b>DOC</b>
 Got you, Indio

<b>INDIO</b>
 You'd only see trace elements--

<b>DOC</b>
           (stopping the rope)
 Braking

<b>INDIO</b>
 --at this depth

<b>DOC</b>
 Seated

(2) PUBLISH OR DIE
          <b>INDIO</b>
                         (Looks around with headlamp)
               … Subterranean geology

          <b>DOC</b>
               You wanna change your thesis?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               We’ve gathered plenty of data about it

          <b>DOC</b>
               I'm a biologist

          <b>INDIO</b>
               You're a wilderness expert

          <b>DOC</b>
               My research wouldn't help

          <b>INDIO</b>
               I'll credit you as an independent consultant

          <b>DOC</b>
               Publish or die

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Tell me about it


(2.5) IT’S MY DREAM
          <b>DOC</b>
               You sure you want tenure?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               It's my dream

          <b>DOC</b>
               And this power geode's gonna get you there…

          <b>INDIO</b>
               One cubic nanometer of this fossilized crystal could power the state of
California with clean energy for a month

          <b>DOC</b>
               According to theory

          <b>INDIO</b>
               All the indicators point to this specific environment manifesting such an element

          <b>DOC</b>
               IF it even exists

          <b>INDIO</b>
              You taught me to believe in the impossible

          <b>DOC</b>
The improbable. Nothing's impossible. Everything has an explanation

     <<Lights flicker, skittering sound>>
(3) AN INKLING
          <b>INDIO</b>
               It's spooky in here

          <b>DOC</b>
               What do you see?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               A creature?

          <b>DOC</b>
               Got a visual?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Remains and droppings

          <b>DOC</b>
               Predators?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Not sure

          <b>DOC</b>
               I’m coming down
		(belaying down)

(4) THERE’S SOMETHING HERE
          <b>INDIO</b>
                         (finds giant stone egg)
               There's something here Doc

          <b>DOC</b>
               What?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               It looks like some sort of calcium formation

          <b>DOC</b>
               Stalagmite?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               In a perfect ovular shape

          <b>DOC</b>
               Hollow?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               The boulder is about a meter across

          <b>DOC</b>
               How tall?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               There's radiation emitting


          <b>DOC</b>
               Heat?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               There appears to be water

          <b>DOC</b>
               Fluids?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Indicating potential crystalline construction

          <b>DOC</b>
               Or ideal conditions for life

(4.5) LIFE FINDS A WAY
          <b>INDIO</b>
               Seems a little deep for that

          <b>DOC</b>
               Life finds a way

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Can you hand over the pickaxe

          <b>DOC</b>
               Why?

          <b>INDIO</b>
               I'm gonna break it open

          <b>DOC</b>
               No!

(5) THE TRUTH
          <b>INDIO</b>
               The rock--

          <b>DOC</b>
               The egg!

          <b>INDIO</b>
               This mineral ore can't be an animal embryo

          <b>DOC</b>
               You just described all the potential characteristics of a prehistoric reptilian ovum

          <b>INDIO</b>
                         (starts kicking at the rock)
               This might be the fossilized crystal energy source we're looking for

          <b>DOC</b>
               Be careful with the spawn exterior!

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Then get over here and take a look

          <b>DOC</b>
               Alright I'm coming

(5.5) SIGNS SAY
          <b>INDIO</b>
                         (taking measurements of the giant rock)
               This radiation reading matches that of the theorized crystalline spectrum

          <b>DOC</b>
                         (grabbing the handheld spectrometer)
               And shows indications of housing life

          <b>INDIO</b>
                         (pulling out pocketknife)
               I'm gonna open it

          <b>DOC</b>
                         (blocks the knife)
               Wait!

          <b>INDIO</b>
               I think you were right

          <b>DOC</b>

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Curiosity Doc

          <b>DOC</b>
               We entered the nest

          <b>INDIO</b>
                         (packs equipment away)
               Then we better get out of here.

          <b>DOC</b>
               We have to go deeper

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Whatever my thesis is worth--

          <b>DOC</b>
               I gotta know

          <b>INDIO</b>
               --It's not worth my life!

                         (wraps ropes around egg)
               I don't wanna meet--

          <b>DOC</b>
               --into something spectacular!

          <b>INDIO</b>
               --whatever is down here.

          <b>DOC</b>
               Aren't you curious?

          <b>INDIO</b>

          <b>INDIO</b>
               You've been the best professor I could ask for

          <b>DOC</b>
               No sudden movements

(11) POSSIBLE ESCAPE

<<RED GLOW FLICKERS, DINO BLINKS>>

          <b>INDIO</b>
               I don't think it can see

          <b>DOC</b>
               I think you've blinded it

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Climb out Doc

          <b>DOC</b>
               No, you first

          <b>INDIO</b>
               I'm not leaving without you

          <b>DOC</b>
               I want a closer look

          <b>INDIO</b>
               At the death trap!?

          <b>DOC</b>
               At the living fossil in front of us

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Please

          <b>DOC</b>
               Pass me your acoustimeter

          <b>INDIO</b>
               You want to do measurements?

          <b>DOC</b>
               I am a biologist

          <b>INDIO</b>
               It might kill you

          <b>DOC</b>
               It might save me

(12) DOMESTICATED DINO
<<DINO BLINKS AND WHINES>>

          <b>INDIO</b>
               … This is proprietary research

          <b>DOC</b>
               Nothing's been documented to live down here

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Maybe the creature's friendly

          <b>DOC</b>
               Maybe I can domesticate it

          <b>INDIO</b>
               Or at least capture it

          <b>DOC</b>
               We'll see

<<DINO “blinks”>>

       <b>INDIO</b>
               Hey there buddy

          <b>DOC</b>
               Wanna name it?
