We're not just some foreigners. I
was born here!


Looks like you might want sections like

Intro
Act
Scene

But lets keep going and see what happens - for now keep doing it manually

You may still want to rewrite parts of the play, but for now, just supplment
the intro, and get some pics, and then leave the dialogue as is for now.

You can probably reuse the intro and pics if you later go back to redraft the
dialogue. But you need to be done over perfect.

TBH I also probably wanna make some of the references more general and not just
straight do a biography - take more artistic license but I suppose the names
are fine

Especially if you want this to be more of the general Asian diasporic experience
with influence from a particular life

One idea is to write the anthology of the asian american experience thru
a traced cultural lineage and have that be played out on stage
as a romance between a two cultural souls through time and culture and in the
diaspora

Maybe you should propose this as a project for anyone interested

also be practically minded - get it done vs. always trying to template
have the mindset regarding work arounds - only learn more if necessary

          Inspired by the question "Where are you from? No, I mean
          where are you from originally?"

          And this video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fJxGxRN5zTk

          Note the word "Oriental" is used here in a historical context
          - this word is no longer an appropriate term in contemporary
          times but reflects the language used by Asians and non-Asians
          in the post-war nightclub era.

## Intro
<div class="box">
The Chinatown Nightclub scene gave a chance for American sailors
docked at the port of San Francisco to experience the exoticism and talent
of local Asian Americans at a time when the Chinese Exclusion Act of was still
in full force under Federal Law.

In the years preceeding WWII, young people were thriving
and sought to spend their cash seeing something new and wondrous. Many successful
nightclubs opened in San Francisco's Chinatown, including X, Y, Z, and the
Forbidden City, notoriously known as the backdrop for the Broadway hit musical
Flower Drum Song.

The following play follows the struggle of two Asian American actors coming to
terms with the mass commodification of their race and the balance of attaining
their dreams of stardom.

Never produced, this piece is looking for a workshop to be rewritten and
made more specific. It is intended to part of a larger tapestry of work that
seeks to define the Asian American lineage of history within the United States.

**CHARLIE**
     Maybe

**FRANCES**
     Even as Orientals

**CHARLIE**
     Only as Orientals?

**FRANCES**
     We're more than just Orientals

**CHARLIE**
     Frances, you're the best

**FRANCES**
     Oh

**CHARLIE**

**FRANCES**

**FRANCES**

**FRANCES**

**FRANCES**

**CHARLIE**

**FRANCES**
     Ooo

**CHARLIE**
     Forever tap dancing and playing ballrooms

**FRANCES**

**CHARLIE**

**FRANCES**

**CHARLIE**

**FRANCES**

**CHARLIE**

**FRANCES**

**FRANCES**
     Uh huh

**CHARLIE**
     Our name in lights

**FRANCES**
     Oh my

**CHARLIE**
     Top billing

**FRANCES**
     Golly

**CHARLIE**
     People will flock

**FRANCES**
     gosh

**CHARLIE**
     They'll say, "I've never seen an Oriental before"

**FRANCES**
     Oh no

**CHARLIE**
     Curious they'll swarm the theatre

**FRANCES**
     Oh yes

**CHARLIE**
     And see our stage names

**FRANCES**

**CHARLIE**

**FRANCES**

**CHARLIE**
     On that small town marquee

**FRANCES**
     Yay

**CHARLIE**
     Reading

**FRANCES**
     Yeah?

**CHARLIE**
     "The Chinese Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers!"

**FRANCES**
     Chinese?

**CHARLIE**
     Starring Charlie Xiang

**FRANCES**
     Wait

**CHARLIE**
     And Frances Mizutani

**FRANCES**
     Charlie

**CHARLIE**
     I can see it now

**FRANCES**
     Hey

**CHARLIE**
     Small town audiences who have never seen -

**FRANCES**
     Charlie!

**CHARLIE**
     - a real Western Asian person

**FRANCES**
     You -

**CHARLIE**
     Oh we'll show em

**FRANCES**
     Listen

**CHARLIE**
     Asians can do anything Caucasians can

**FRANCES**
     Can you -

**CHARLIE**
     What do ya say

          *They are halfway through changing their outfits.*

**FRANCES**
     You want to bill us as the Chinese Fred Astaire and
     Ginger Rogers

**CHARLIE**
     Yeah doll

**FRANCES**
     Why?

**CHARLIE**
     Frances

**FRANCES**
     Are you sure that'll do anything?

**CHARLIE**
     Look

**FRANCES**
     Why bill us like that?

**CHARLIE**
     Hey

**FRANCES**
     I don't understand

**CHARLIE**
     C'mon

**FRANCES**
     What are you trying to get?

**CHARLIE**
     Doll. It's just for publicity

**FRANCES**
     What

**CHARLIE**
     You know, to fit in with the club's theme

**FRANCES**
     Why

**CHARLIE**
     The Forbidden City, and how close we are to Chinatown

**FRANCES**
     I don't think it's a good idea

**CHARLIE**
     What

**FRANCES**
     I mean after all

**CHARLIE**
     Why

**FRANCES**
     You know I'm not Chinese right?

**CHARLIE**
     Frances

**FRANCES**
     I'm Japanese

**CHARLIE**
     Yeah

**FRANCES**
     Mizutani is a Japanese last name

**CHARLIE**
     Uh huh

**FRANCES**
     So it wouldn't make sense

**CHARLIE**
     Doll

**FRANCES**
     Shouldn't we be something else?

**CHARLIE**
     Huh

**FRANCES**
     What about the Japanese Ginger Rogers and Chinese Fred
     Astaire

**CHARLIE**
     Hmm

**FRANCES**
     Or what if we didn't compare ourselves to Caucasian
     performers at all?

**CHARLIE**
     Well

**FRANCES**
     What if we just performed as ourselves

**CHARLIE**
     I mean

**FRANCES**
     Under our own names?

**CHARLIE**
     Ha

**FRANCES**
     Wouldn't that be better?

**CHARLIE**
     It's necessary marketing Tony said and he does all the
     promoting for the club. He knows what sells to white
     audiences who don't know anything about us Orientals

**FRANCES**
     Teach them then. Show them the differences between
     Japanese and Chinese culture

**CHARLIE**
     This is just -

**FRANCES**
     I can't accept this.

**CHARLIE**
     But

**FRANCES**
     I don't think it's right

**CHARLIE**
     It's not -

**FRANCES**
     I think we must fight to educate our fellow Americans
     about our heritage. We're not just some foreigners. I
     was born here! I was educated here!

**CHARLIE**
     I know

**FRANCES**
     I'm not Chinese. I shouldn't have to have my race
     exploited like this and even if I do, it should at least
     be accurate! Why not bill me as Japanese Frances
     Mizutani and educate the American masses craving
     entertainment about all that we Orientals can do

**CHARLIE**
     Look. Frances. I'm not trying to sabotage you

**FRANCES**
     It sure feels like it

**CHARLIE**
     It's not an attack

**FRANCES**
     Uh

**CHARLIE**
     Not on you nor your heritage

**FRANCES**
     but

**CHARLIE**
     It's a tactic for marketing purposes

**FRANCES**
     and

**CHARLIE**
     To keep in theme with the club

**FRANCES**
     Ugh

**CHARLIE**
     Since we're so close to Chinatown

**FRANCES**
     so

**CHARLIE**
     It's about us Orientals sticking together

**FRANCES**
     Us

**CHARLIE**
     Bonding over a common cultural ancestry

**FRANCES**
     Mmm

**CHARLIE**
     The immigrant child experience

**FRANCES**
     Well

**CHARLIE**
     Look, I don't like this either. Yeah I agree we
     shouldn't even have to compare ourselves to mainstream
     artists. I'm a good enough tap dancer to bill under my
     own name. But this is just the first step. We gotta
     prove to Tony that we can raise the roof on this here
     joint, right doll? I believe in everything you said.
     You're right, let's teach Americans about the
     differences between Japanese and Chinese. Once we get
     exposure let's proudly display our racial heritage in
     our shows. I'll support any effort that you do.

**FRANCES**
     Aww

**CHARLIE**
     I'll be there by your side advocating for you

**FRANCES**
     How sweet

**CHARLIE**
     We're partners now and what we do, we do together

**FRANCES**
     Well

**CHARLIE**
     So I'll back you up

**FRANCES**
     Uh huh

**CHARLIE**
     if you back me up

**FRANCES**
     Hmm

**CHARLIE**
     Ok doll?

**FRANCES**
     Uh

**CHARLIE**
     Beautiful princess

**FRANCES**
     Aww

**CHARLIE**
     So smart

**FRANCES**
     Stop

**CHARLIE**
     And talented

**FRANCES**
     Oh

**CHARLIE**
     All at once

**FRANCES**
     I'm so flattered

**CHARLIE**
     And to prove how serious I am, I got you this
               *(Hands her a sheet of paper)*
     A marriage license application

**FRANCES**
     Wow

**CHARLIE**
     I know we just met

**FRANCES**
     We just.

**CHARLIE**
     But this will make it easier to book rooms together when
     we travel the country

**FRANCES**
     You're serious

**CHARLIE**
     I'm serious

**FRANCES**
     You want this

**CHARLIE**
     I wanna see your name in lights everywhere on tour
     sparkling dazzlingly bright. The endlessly talented tap
     dancing Japanese gal Frances Mizutani and Chinese fella
     Charlie Xiang.

**FRANCES**
     You want to tour with me?

**CHARLIE**
     If you wanna embark on this amazing adventure with me,
     I'm ready to do this with you

**FRANCES**
     I can't believe it.

          *They are almost done changing into their new dress
          and suit. He zips her up and she straightens his
          bowtie.*

          *Offstage: "60 seconds til curtain!"*

**FRANCES**
     Ok, I agree. I agree to the billing, I agree to the
     marriage, I trust you.

**CHARLIE**
     You're amazing

**FRANCES**
     You're incredible

**CHARLIE**
     I couldn't have asked for a better dance partner

**FRANCES**
     Oh you

**CHARLIE**
     You're an angel

**FRANCES**
     Tee hee

**CHARLIE**
     C'mon, I can't wait to wow the crowd with you

**FRANCES**
     Let's knock em out

**CHARLIE**
     You betcha

**FRANCES**
     Let's be kings of swing

**CHARLIE**
     And enjoy what the night brings

          *They throw their tap shoes on and rush offstage to
          the sounds of big band and thunderous applause*

                                                        END.
