<h2>Intro</h2>
<div class="box">
<p>Subterranean follows the journey of two scientists exploring a cave in search
of a mysterious geode promising fortune and fame. With captivating imagery and
concise dialogue, this play examines how far one should go in search of truth
and whether the pursuit of life is worth risking its loss.</p>

<h2>ACT I</h2>

<h3>Scene 1: Interior Cave,
Calaveras Country</h3>

<i>Spotlight up on Indio being lowered by rope down
into a damp cave. Indio wears cave exploring gear -
a helmet and headlamp. On the other side of the
rope is Doc.</i>

<b>INDIO</b>
Belay on Doc

<b>DOC</b>
On Belay Indio

<b>INDIO</b>
I don't think it's here

<b>DOC</b>
Doesn't your dissertation depend on finding it

<b>INDIO</b>
It would be deeper

<b>DOC</b>
So lower?

<b>INDIO</b>
Yeah

<b>DOC</b>
(belaying the rope)
Lowering

Indio lowered deeper into the stalagmites

<b>INDIO</b>
Tension Doc

<b>DOC</b>
Got you, Indio

<b>INDIO</b>
You'd only see trace elements

<b>DOC</b>
(stopping the rope)
Braking

<b>INDIO</b>
At this depth

<b>DOC</b>
Seated

<b>INDIO</b>
(Looks around with headlamp, takes
measurements of cavern depth with laser
device)
Subterranean geology

<b>DOC</b>
You wanna change your topic?

<b>INDIO</b>
We got plenty of data on that

<b>DOC</b>
I'm a biologist

<b>INDIO</b>
You're a wilderness expert

<b>DOC</b>
My research wouldn't help

<b>INDIO</b>
I'll credit you as an independent consultant

<b>DOC</b>
Publish or die

<b>INDIO</b>
Tell me about it

<b>DOC</b>
You sure you want tenure

<b>INDIO</b>
It's my dream

<b>DOC</b>
And this power geode's gonna get you there

<b>INDIO</b>
(pulls out a handheld spectrometer to
inspect cavern wall)
One cubic nanometer of this fossilized crystal could
power the state of California with clean energy for a
month

<b>DOC</b>
According to theory

<b>INDIO</b>
(running the handheld spectrometer along
the limestone)
All the indicators point to this specific environment
providing the ideal conditions for manifesting such an
element

<b>DOC</b>
What evidence do you have that something like that even
exists

<b>INDIO</b>
(measuring devices beep)
I thought your National Geographic tours would have
taught you to expect the unexpected

<b>DOC</b>
All I've learned is that everything is connected to some
common ancestor in the past which means everything has
an origin and explanation

Shadows move across the light

<b>INDIO</b>
It's spooky in here

<b>DOC</b>
What do you see?

<b>INDIO</b>
(peering onto a cave shelf)
A mammal?

<b>DOC</b>
Got a visual?

<b>INDIO</b>
Remains and droppings

<b>DOC</b>
Predators?

<b>INDIO</b>
(finds giant stone eggs lodged in the
cavern wall)
There's something here Doc

<b>DOC</b>
What?

<b>INDIO</b>
It looks like some sort of calcium formation

<b>DOC</b>
Stalagmite?

<b>INDIO</b>
In a perfect ovular shape

<b>DOC</b>
Hollow?

<b>INDIO</b>
The boulder is about a meter across

<b>DOC</b>
How tall?

<b>INDIO</b>
There's radiation emitting

<b>DOC</b>
Heat?

<b>INDIO</b>
There appears to be water

<b>DOC</b>
Fluids?

<b>INDIO</b>
Indicating potential crystalline construction

<b>DOC</b>
Or ideal conditions for life

<b>INDIO</b>
Seems a little deep for that

<b>DOC</b>
Life finds a way

<b>INDIO</b>
Can you belay down the pickaxe

<b>DOC</b>
Why

<b>INDIO</b>
I'm gonna break it open

<b>DOC</b>
No!

<b>INDIO</b>
The rock

<b>DOC</b>
The egg!

<b>INDIO</b>
This mineral ore can't be an animal embryo

<b>DOC</b>
You just described all the potential characteristics of
a prehistoric reptilian ovum

<b>INDIO</b>
(starts kicking at the rock)
This might be the fossilized crystal energy source we're
looking for

<b>DOC</b>
Be careful with the spawn exterior!

<b>INDIO</b>
Then come down and take a look

<b>DOC</b>
(belaying down)
Alright I'm coming

<b>INDIO</b>
(taking measurements of the giant rock)
This radiation reading matches that of the theorized
crystalline spectrum

<b>DOC</b>
(grabbing the handheld spectrometer)
And shows indications of housing life

<b>INDIO</b>
(pulling out pocketknife)
I'm gonna open it

<b>DOC</b>
(blocks the knife)
Wait!

A loud roar echoes through the cave

<b>INDIO</b>
What was that

<b>DOC</b>
Mother

<b>INDIO</b>
I think you were right

<b>DOC</b>
Something's alive down here

<b>INDIO</b>
Curiosity Doc

<b>DOC</b>
We entered the nest

<b>INDIO</b>
(packs equipment away)
We better get out of here

<b>DOC</b>
We have to go deeper

<b>INDIO</b>
Whatever my thesis is worth

<b>DOC</b>
I gotta know

<b>INDIO</b>
(climbing out)
It's not worth my life

A loud roar, flash of light, rumbling

<b>DOC</b>
Where are ya girl?

<b>INDIO</b>
(stops)
Doc!

<b>DOC</b>
(turns on headlamp, packs the handheld
spectrometer, double checks climbing gear
for security)
I think

<b>INDIO</b>
Don't go down there!

<b>DOC</b>
whoever laid these eggs

<b>INDIO</b>
(grabs onto Doc's rope)
Let's get these crystals

<b>DOC</b>
is calling us

<b>INDIO</b>
get out of here

<b>DOC</b>
(breaks free of Indio's grasp)
Take them, they'll hatch

<b>INDIO</b>
(starts climbing out, packs the stone
eggs into gearbag)
I don't wanna meet

<b>DOC</b>
Into something spectacular

<b>INDIO</b>
Whatever is down there

<b>DOC</b>
(belaying into the depths of the cavern)
Aren't you curious

<b>INDIO</b>
(belays down and grabs Doc)
Not now thanks

<b>DOC</b>
(breaks free of Indio's grasp)
We could be

<b>INDIO</b>
(still trying to physically drag Doc up
and out of the cave, Doc resists)
Does it matter

<b>DOC</b>
The first

<b>INDIO</b>
Let's move

<b>DOC</b>
to find

<b>INDIO</b>
(senses a shadow, confronts the source)
It's close

<b>DOC</b>
a new

<b>INDIO</b>
(turns to Doc)
something

<b>DOC</b>
(turns to Indio)
extant

<b>INDIO</b>
is

<b>DOC</b>
subterranean

<b>INDIO</b>
behind

<b>DOC</b>
species

<b>INDIO</b>
you

Dinosaur appears.

They turn slowly to face the ferocious creature,
its shadow aggressively projected against the
amazed and terrified expressions of the cave
explorers.

Silence.

<b>DOC</b>
(takes off glasses to get a better look)
It's beautiful

<b>INDIO</b>
(starts)
I'm out

<b>DOC</b>
(stops)
Don't move

<b>INDIO</b>
You're right
(dinosaur stares)

<b>DOC</b>
I've enjoyed working with you

<b>INDIO</b>
Doc

<b>DOC</b>
Indio, you've been a great mentee

<b>INDIO</b>
You've been the best professor I could ask for

<b>DOC</b>
No sudden movements

No one moves. Dinosaur blinks.

<b>INDIO</b>
I don't think it can see

<b>DOC</b>
I think you've blinded it

<b>INDIO</b>
Climb out Doc

<b>DOC</b>
(adjusts the headlamp and pulls out the
handheld spectrometer)
No, you first

<b>INDIO</b>
I'm not leaving without you

<b>DOC</b>
I want a closer look

<b>INDIO</b>
At the death trap!?

<b>DOC</b>
(taking measurements)
At the living fossil in front of us

<b>INDIO</b>
Please

<b>DOC</b>
Pass me your acoustimeter

<b>INDIO</b>
You want to do measurements?

<b>DOC</b>
I am a biologist

<b>INDIO</b>
It might kill you

<b>DOC</b>
It might save me

Doc and Indio consider the Dinosaur. It rumbles
gently.

<b>INDIO</b>
This is proprietary research

<b>DOC</b>
Nothing's been documented to live down here

<b>INDIO</b>
Maybe the creature's friendly

<b>DOC</b>
Maybe I can domesticate it

<b>INDIO</b>
Or at least capture it

<b>DOC</b>
We'll see

<b>INDIO</b>
(approaching the sleepy blinking
dinosaur)
Hey there buddy

<b>DOC</b>
Wanna name it?

<b>INDIO</b>
How about jaws

Dinosaur chomps, splash of color, lights out.

(1) BELAY ON
<b><b>INDIO</b></b>
 Belay on Doc

<b><b>DOC</b></b>
 On Belay Indio

<b><b>INDIO</b></b>
 I don't think it's here

<b><b>DOC</b></b>
 Doesn't your dissertation depend on finding it?

<b><b>INDIO</b></b>
 It would be deeper

<b><b>DOC</b></b>
 So lower?

<b><b>INDIO</b></b>
 Yeah

<b><b>DOC</b></b>
           (belaying the rope)
 Lowering

      (Indio lowered deeper into the stalagmites)

<b><b>INDIO</b></b>
 Tension Doc

<b><b>DOC</b></b>
 Got you, Indio

<b><b>INDIO</b></b>
 You'd only see trace elements--

<b><b>DOC</b></b>
           (stopping the rope)
 Braking

<b><b>INDIO</b></b>
 --at this depth

<b><b>DOC</b></b>
 Seated

(2) PUBLISH OR DIE
          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
                         (Looks around with headlamp)
               Subterranean geology

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               You wanna change your topic?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               We got plenty of data on that

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               I'm a biologist

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>

               Publish or die

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Tell me about it


(2.5) IT’S MY DREAM
          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               You sure you want tenure?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               It's my dream

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               And this power geode's gonna get you there…

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               One cubic nanometer of this fossilized crystal could power the state of
California with clean energy for a month

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               According to theory

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               All the indicators point to this specific environment manifesting such an element

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               IF it even exists

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
              You taught me to believe in the impossible

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
The improbable. Nothing's impossible. Everything has an explanation

     <<Lights flicker, skittering sound>>
(3) AN INKLING
          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               It's spooky in here

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               What do you see?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               A creature?

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Got a visual?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Remains and droppings

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Predators?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Not sure

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               I’m coming down
		(belaying down)

(4) THERE’S SOMETHING HERE
          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
                         (finds giant stone egg)
               There's something here Doc

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               What?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               It looks like some sort of calcium formation

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Stalagmite?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               In a perfect ovular shape

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Hollow?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               The boulder is about a meter across

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               How tall?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               There's radiation emitting

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Heat?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               There appears to be water

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Fluids?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Indicating potential crystalline construction

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Or ideal conditions for life

(4.5) LIFE FINDS A WAY
          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Seems a little deep for that

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Life finds a way

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Can you hand over the pickaxe

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Why?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               I'm gonna break it open

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               No!

(5) THE TRUTH
          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               The rock--

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               The egg!

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               This mineral ore can't be an animal embryo

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               You just described all the potential characteristics of a prehistoric reptilian ovum

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
                         (starts kicking at the rock)
               This might be the fossilized crystal energy source we're looking for

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Be careful with the spawn exterior!

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Then get over here and take a look

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Alright I'm coming

(5.5) SIGNS SAY
          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
                         (taking measurements of the giant rock)
               This radiation reading matches that of the theorized crystalline spectrum

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
                         (grabbing the handheld spectrometer)
               And shows indications of housing life

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
                         (pulling out pocketknife)
               I'm gonna open it

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
                         (blocks the knife)
               Wait!

<<ROAR>>

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               … What was that?

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Mother

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               I think you were right

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Something's alive down here

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Curiosity Doc

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               We entered the nest

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
                         (packs equipment away)
               Then we better get out of here.

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               We have to go deeper

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Whatever my thesis is worth--

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               I gotta know

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               --It's not worth my life!

<<ROAR, RUMBLING, FLICKERING LIGHTS>>

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               Where are ya girl?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Doc! Don’t go down there!

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               I think whoever laid this egg--

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Let's get this crystal--

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               --is calling us.

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               --and get out of here!

(7.5) SOMETHING SPECTACULAR
          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
                         (rolls egg to <b><b>INDIO</b></b>)
               Take it, it’ll hatch--

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
                         (wraps ropes around egg)
               I don't wanna meet--

               Aren't you curious?

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Not now thanks.

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               We could be the first--

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Let's move!

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
              --to find--

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               It's close.

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               --a new extant--

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>

               I don't think it can see

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               I think you've blinded it

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               Climb out Doc

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               No, you first

          <b><b>INDIO</b></b>
               It might kill you

          <b><b>DOC</b></b>
               It might save me
